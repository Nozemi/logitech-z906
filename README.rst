LogitechÂ® Z906 Surround Sound Speakers
======================================

Overview
--------

5.1 surround sound speaker system with the amplifier built into the subwoofer
and managed by an external control console attached using a
`DE-15 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-subminiature>`_ connector.

Purpose
-------

Provide unofficial documentation of the serial protocol and possible
firmware/configuration modifications.

The console `firmware <firmware.rst>`_ can be modified to:

* Automatically turn the speakers on when power is supplied.
* Change the automatic standby idle timeout from the default 2 hours.

Automatic standby
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hold the "level" button for 5 seconds (until the level change light goes out).
There's no other indication that anything has changed. Use the reset procedure
to get this into a known state (automatic standby enabled).
