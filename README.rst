LogitechÂ® Z906 Surround Sound Speakers
======================================

Overview

5.1 surround sound speaker system with the amplifier built into the subwoofer
and managed by an external control console attached using a DB-15 connector.

Purpose
-------

Provide unofficial documentation of the serial protocol and possible
firmware/configuration modifications.

The console `firmware <firmware.rst>`_ can be modified to:

* Automatically turn the speakers on when power is supplied.

The amplifier can be configured through the `serial interface <interface.rst>`_
and `protocol <protocol.rst>`_ commands to disable the automatic standby idle
timeout.
